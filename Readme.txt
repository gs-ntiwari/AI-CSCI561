This folder contains the code for three assignments given under CSCI561 Artificial Intelligence course. 

HW1 - Implement AStart, BFS, and UCS to find a route from a source to a target avoiding obstacles.

HW2 - Design and implement a 2 player strategy game -Halma. The main idea is to identify valid moves at any point and make the right move by evaluating the current state of the game.
